Mouse emulation with keyboard in X11

Use your keyboard to emulate mouse events, such as mouse movement, left click
and paste (i.e. middle click).

The project supports basic JSON-style configuration, as follows:
  1. "keymouse" block
     - trigger                 enable/disable mouse emulation with this key
     - up, left, down, right   these keys are used to move the mouse around
     - click                   left-click key
     - paste                   this key represents the middle mousebutton
     - speed                   number of pixels to move at each keystroke
     - sleep                   wait time (in usec) between sampling keystrokes
     - slow                    slow down mouse movement by holding down this key
     - numlock                 set it to true if your numlock is on

Use names from /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h for the keys, without the "XK_"
prefix. See cfg/default.cfg for an example configuration. The default location
of the configuration file is ~/.keymouse.cfg.

TODO: use xcd library instead of xlib
